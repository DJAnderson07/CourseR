# Getting started with *git*

*git* is a version control system for collaborating on code. The largest git 
  hosting engine is [github](https://github.com). However, github is separate
  from *git* itself. There are multiple git host sites. For example 
  [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) is another popular host site that has some
  advantages over github like free private repositories (github repositories 
  are all public, unless you pay a monthly fee). For this course, we'll be using
  *git* with github. You will need to only understand the very basics of *git*
  for the purposes of this class, but if you are going to go on to do any 
  serious coding, you'll want to become more familiar with it. The first two 
  chapters of the *Pro Git* book, available 
  [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) will provide you with most all the 
  background you need. The purpose of this document is to provide you an 
  overview of installing *git* and cloning the course repository.

## Installing *git*
Installing *git* is straight forward. Simply go to the downloads portion of the
  *git* [website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and click on the Windows logo.

You should then get an executable file (.exe). Launch the file and you will be 
  prompted by a security warning. Click "Run".

The installer then should launch.

![winGitSetup](/Users/Daniel/Dropbox/Teaching/CourseR/git_Tutorials/img/winGitSetup.png)

Click "Next" until you get to the path setup. Make sure that "Use Git from the 
  Windows Command Prompt" is selected.

**Note.** After running the installer, *git* will be installed on your computer.
  However, you will not see it in your Program Files or anywhere else. Rather, 
  it is installed as part of the command line tools, and you'll access *git* via
  the Command Prompt. 

## Cloning the course repository

This tutorial describes how to clone the course repository through the Command 
  Prompt. There are many free *git* graphic user interfaces (GUIs) that many 
  people use. The windows *git* installation also installs a GUI. I don't know 
  any of the GUIs, and prefer to just work with the code, but you can feel 
  free to explore them.

### Launch the Command Prompt
Command Prompt is a windows application to interface with software, etc., with
  code. It is available from the start menu in the Accessories folder

After launching the Command Prompt, change your directory, via `CD` to where you 
  would like all the course materials saved. One of the easiest ways to do this 
  is to type `CD` and then a space, and then just drag the folder to terminal 
  where you want the materials saved. The path will then be automatically copied 
  into terminal.

Finally, go to the 
  [course github repository](https://github.com/DJAnderson07/CourseR) and copy 
  the link to clone the repository. 

![github](/Users/Daniel/Dropbox/Teaching/CourseR/git_Tutorials/img/github.png)

and type `git clone` into the Command Prompt, followed by the link (i.e., paste 
  the link). It should like like this

```
git clone https://github.com/DJAnderson07/CourseR.git
```
After you hit enter, the course materials should all be cloned (copied) into 
  your directory.

## Updating the repository
As mentioned in the opening, if you're planning on doing any serious coding, you
  should really dig into *git* a bit more. However, for the purposes of this 
  class, you should only need one command: `git pull`. The process is pretty
  easy. Just follow the following steps

1. Launch the Command Prompt
2. type `CD` followed by a space, then drag the course folder (CourseR) into 
   the Command Prompt to get the path. Hit enter.
3. Type `git pull` and hit enter. Assuming the repository has been updated, 
   the Command Prompt should print some messages about some files.

![winGitPull](/Users/Daniel/Dropbox/Teaching/CourseR/git_Tutorials/img/winGitPull.png)

4. Type `git status`. If you see the following message, you should be good to 
   go. If you see something like "master ahead of branch by X commits", or some
   other message, you are not up to date. Make sure you're in the right 
   directory and try `git pull` again. Otherwise, contact me and I can try to 
   help you diagnose the problem.

# On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```
