# Getting started with *git*

*git* is a version control system for collaborating on code. The largest git 
  hosting engine is [github](https://github.com). However, github is separate
  from *git* itself. There are multiple git host sites. For example 
  [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) is another popular host site that has some
  advantages over github like free private repositories (github repositories 
  are all public, unless you pay a monthly fee). For this course, we'll be using
  *git* with github. You will need to only understand the very basics of *git*
  for the purposes of this class, but if you are going to go on to do any 
  serious coding, you'll want to become more familiar with it. The first two 
  chapters of the *Pro Git* book, available 
  [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) will provide you with most all the 
  background you need. The purpose of this document is to provide you an 
  overview of installing *git* and cloning the course repository.

## Installing *git*
Installing *git* is straight forward. Simply go to the downloads portion of the
  *git* [website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and click on the Mac OS X logo.

You should then get a .dmg file named something close to (or exactly) 
git-2.5.3-intel-universal-mavericks.dmg 

![gitDMG](/Users/Daniel/Dropbox/Teaching/CourseR/git_Tutorials/img/gitDMG.png)

Double click the dmg file and you should see a .pkg installer

![gitPKG](/Users/Daniel/Dropbox/Teaching/CourseR/git_Tutorials/img/gitPKG.png)

If you just double click the pkg installer you will likely be told it cannot 
  open because it's from an unidentified developer. 

![unidentifiedDeveloper](/Users/Daniel/Dropbox/Teaching/CourseR/git_Tutorials/img/unidentifiedDeveloper.png)

To get around this you'll need to "right" click on the pkg installer (by either
 placing two fingers on the trackpad and clicking or holding control while 
 clicking), and then selecting "open".

You will still be prompted by the unidentified developer warning. Just select 
  "Open". You'll then be guided through the installer.

**Note.** After running the installer, *git* will be installed on your computer.
  However, you will not see it in your applications or anywhere else. Rather, it
  is installed as part of the command line tools, and you'll access *git* via
  terminal.

## Cloning the course repository

This tutorial describes how to clone the course repository through terminal. 
  There are many free *git* graphic user interfaces (GUIs) that many people use.
  I don't know them, and prefer to just work with the code, but you can feel 
  free to explore them.

### Launch terminal
Terminal is a mac application available at /Applications/Utilities/Terminal. 
  Alternatively, you can use Mac's spotlight feature by pressing command and 
  space bar. Then, type terminal, and the application will come up.

Next, change your directory, via `cd` to where you would like all the course
  materials saved. One of the easiest ways to do this is to type `cd` and then a
  space, and then just drag the folder to terminal where you want the materials
  saved. The path will then be automatically copied into terminal.

Finally, go to the 
  [course github repository](https://github.com/DJAnderson07/CourseR) and copy 
  the link to clone the repository. 

![github](/Users/Daniel/Dropbox/Teaching/CourseR/git_Tutorials/img/github.png)

and type `git clone` into terminal, followed by the link (i.e., paste the link). 
  It should like like this

```
git clone https://github.com/DJAnderson07/CourseR.git
```
After you hit enter, the course materials should all be cloned (copied) into 
  your directory.

**Note.** If you do not have command line tools installed, you will be prompted
  to do so. You will need to install the command line tools to work with *git*
  via terminal.

## Updating the repository
As mentioned in the opening, if you're planning on doing any serious coding, you
  should really dig into *git* a bit more. However, for the purposes of this 
  class, you should only need one command: `git pull`. The process is pretty
  easy. Just follow the following steps

1. Launch terminal
2. type `cd` followed by a space, then drag the course folder (CourseR) into 
   terminal to get the path. Hit enter.
3. Type `git pull` and hit enter. Assuming the repository has been updated, 
   terminal should print some messages about some files.

![gitPull](/Users/Daniel/Dropbox/School/CourseR/git_Tutorials/img/gitPull.png)

4. Type `git status`. If you see the following message, you should be good to 
   go. If you see something like "master ahead of branch by X commits", or some
   other message, you are not up to date. Make sure you're in the right 
   directory and try `git pull` again. Otherwise, contact me and I can try to 
   help you diagnose the problem.

```
# On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```
