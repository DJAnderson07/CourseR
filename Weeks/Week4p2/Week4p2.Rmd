## Today's Agenda
* Classes and methods (object oriented programming)
* Scoping
* Infix functions
* Storing and applying functions with `source()`

----
## Objects 
* Every object has a *class* and a *method*. This is generally true of all 
  object-oriented (OO) programming, and not specific to R.
* R has 3 systems, which differ in the way classes and methods are
  implemented: S3, S4, and Reference Classes (RC).
* S3 is the is simplest and most widely used OO system. This is where we will
  focus most of our attention.

## Classes

*** =left

* Use `class()` to determine the class

```{r}
d <- read.csv("./data/longley.csv")
mod <- lm(Employed ~ Population, 
			data = d)
class(mod)
print(mod)
```

*** =right

* Redefine the class

```{r}
class(mod) <- "data.frame"
print(mod)
```

* The `print()` function now tries to use the `data.frame` method for the
  generic `print()` function, rather thant the `lm` method for `print()`.

----
However, note that the data are still there (the generic function calls are
  just using the `data.frame` class, rather than the `lm` class).

```{r}
mod$coefficients
```

----
## Our function for today
# Simulating dice rolls with the `sample()` function

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?sample
# x = numbers of the die
# size = number of dice
# replace = can a number be sampled more than once?
```
![sampleHelp](./assets/img/sampleHelp.png)

----
## Roll two dice with six sides

```{r}
sample(x = 1:6, size = 2, replace = TRUE)
```

----
## Replicate the roll 100 times

```{r}
replicate(100, sample(x = 1:6, size = 2, replace = TRUE))
```

----
## Transpose the output for nicer output

```{r}
t(replicate(100, sample(x = 1:6, size = 2, replace = TRUE)))
```

----
## Wrap it in a function

# What should the formals be?
```{r, eval = FALSE}
t(replicate(100, sample(x = 1:6, size = 2, replace = TRUE)))
```

----
## `dice()` function

```{r}
dice <- function(nsides, nrolls, ndice) {
	experiment <- t(replicate(nrolls, sample(1:nsides, ndice, replace = TRUE)))

return(experiment)
}
```

Test it out

```{r}
rolls <- dice(4, 1e5, 3)
rolls
```

----
## Back to classes
# Defining class for the `dice()` function

```{r}
dice <- function(nsides, nrolls, ndice) {
	experiment <- t(replicate(nrolls, sample(1:nsides, ndice, replace = TRUE)))

return(structure(experiment, class = "dice"))
}

rolls <- dice(4, 1e5, 3)
class(rolls)
```

----
## Defining methods
Now, because we have a class, we can define a method. Let's define a generic
  plot function for objects of class "dice"

```{r}
plot.dice <- function(x) {
	tot <- rowSums(x)
	
	par(mfrow = c(2, 1), 
		oma = c(5, 4, 1, 0), # outer margins
		mar = c(0, 0, 1, 1)) # margins for each plot
	hist(tot, 
		main = "Histogram of Sum of Simulated Dice Rolls", 
		xlab = "Sum of each roll")
			abline(v = mean(tot), col = "red", lwd = 3)
			abline(v = mean(tot) - sd(tot), col = "gray", lwd = 2, lty = 2)
			abline(v = mean(tot) + sd(tot), col = "gray", lwd = 2, lty = 2)
	boxplot(tot, horizontal = TRUE, frame = FALSE)
}
```

----
```{r}
plot(rolls)
```

----
## Set generic summary method for class "dice"

```{r}
summary.dice <- function(x) {
	cat("First 6 Rolls", "", sep = "\n")
	print(x[1:6, ])

	cat("", "Frequencies of Sums", sep = "\n")
	print(table(rowSums(x)))

	cat("", "Frequency of Roll Patterns", sep = "\n")
	
	print(table(apply(x, 1, paste0, collapse = "")))
	

return(invisible(list(
			SumFrequencies = table(rowSums(x)), 
			PatternFrequencies = table(apply(x, 1, paste0, collapse = ""))
			)
		)
	)
}
```

----
```{r}
smmry <- summary(rolls)
```

----
```{r}
str(smmry)
```

----
## Other options
For the S3 system, there are other (potentially better) ways to set classes
  and generic functions. For example

```{r}
dice <- function(nsides, nrolls, ndice) UseMethod("dice")

dice.default <- function(nsides, nrolls, ndice) {
	experiment <- t(replicate(nrolls, sample(1:nsides, ndice, replace = TRUE)))

return(structure(experiment, class = "dice"))
}
dice(8, 5, 4)
```

----
## Dice game

```{r}
dice.game <- function(x) {
	roll <- as.vector(dice.default(6, 1, x))
	fives <- (roll == 5) * 50
	ones <- (roll == 1) * 100
	if(sum(table(roll) == 3) > 0) {
		threeKind <- (table(roll) == 3)[table(roll) == 3] * 
				(as.numeric(names(table(roll)))[table(roll) == 3] * 100)
		return(sum(fives, ones, threeKind))
	}
	else {
		return(sum(fives, ones))
	}
} 

trial <- 6
class(trial) <- "game"
dice(trial)
```

----
## Methods
You can view the methods of any function using `methods()`

```{r}
methods(plot)
```

----
## Summary: Classes and Methods
* Class is metadata that defines the type of object
* Method is a specific function linked to the class, often constructed through
  generic functions.
* Having an understanding of classes and methods can be really helpful when
  writing packages (although there are packages that make writing packages easier).
* You may want to think about some default plot, print, or summary methods for
  your functions, especially if you're applying them regularly.

# Lexical Scoping
![nestingDolls](./assets/img/nestingDolls.jpg)

----
## Lexical scoping 
* Search for symbols (objects) based on the nesting of how they were 
  *created*, not how they were *called*.
* You can generally determine how a value is being called by inspecting the
  function.

## Name masking

*** =left
R will look within the current environment when objects are called. If it can't find them, it will look one level "up".

```{r}
y <- 7

foo <- function(x) {
	x + y
}
foo(3); foo(5)
```
*** =right

```{r}
foo2 <- function(x) {
	y <- rnorm(10, 100, 5)
	x + y
} 
foo2(3)
```

---- &twocol
## More on name masking

*** =left

```{r}
z <- 1e9
b <- function(x) {
	y <- rnorm(length(x), 100, 10)
	
	lm <- function(x) {
		z <- 2
		(-1*x)/z
	}
	lm(y)
}

b(1:3)
```

*** =right

```{r}
a <- function(x) x^2

f <- function(x) {
	a <- function(y) {
		z <- rnorm(length(y), 
				    mean(y, na.rm = TRUE), 
				    sd(y, na.rm = TRUE)
				    )
		x + z
	}
return(4 + a(x))
}
f(2:4)
```

# Infix operators

----
## What is an infix operator?

Infix operators are functions that do not require the name of the function precedes the arguments. Infix operators come between two arguments. 

# Built-in infix functions
There are numerous built-in infix operators (see http://bxhorn.com/data-infix-operators-in-r/)

![infixOperators](./assets/img/infixOperators.png)

----
## Create your own infix functions
Let's create an infix operator that returns a logical vector corresponding to whether a given value (within a vector) is within the range of a different vector.

```{r}
`%w%` <- function(x, vector) {
	x >= min(vector, na.rm = TRUE) & x <= max(vector, na.rm = TRUE)
}

5:10 %w% 8:70
8:70 %w% 5:10
```

----
## Another example
Now we'll create an infix operator that returns summary information on the relation between two vectors.

```{r}
`%smry%` <- function(x, y) {
	if(length(x) != length(y)) {
		stop("Vectors must be of the same length")
	}
	cat(
		paste("Covariance =", cov(x, y, use = "complete.obs")),
		paste("Correlation =", cor(x, y, use = "complete.obs")),
		paste("Proportion x cases above Mean of y =", 
			(table(x > mean(y, na.rm = TRUE)) / length(x))[2] ),
		paste("Proportion x cases within the range of y =", 
			(table(x %w% y) / length(x))[2] ),
		sep = "\n")
} 
```

---- &twocol
## Example continued

*** =left

```{r}
a <- rnorm(1e5, 100, 5)
b <- rnorm(1e5, 105, 5)

a %smry% b
b %smry% a
```

*** =right

```{r}
a[1:100] %smry% b[1:100]
```
<br>

```{r}
a[1:100] %smry% b
```

# Using `source()` with functions

----
## Next best thing to a package: `source()`

When you have a function, or set of function to apply, but you want to keep
  your code tidy, you can store just the function in a separate script and access it via `source()`. This is most helpful when you have a function that you apply regularly across multiple scripts. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?source
```
![source](./assets/img/sourceHelp.png)

----
## Function for source file

1. Write a function
    * Below is a function I apply regularly to batch load a set of csv files
      into a list.
2. Save it as a separate R script

```{r}
readFiles <- function(dir, ...) {
	oldDir <- getwd() # Get current working directory
	setwd(as.character(dir)) # Change directory to where data are stored
	
	files <- list.files(...) # List all the files in the directory
	dl <- sapply(1:length(files), function(i) read.csv(files[i])) # Read data
	names(dl) <- substr(files, 1, nchar(files) - 4) # Name the elements of the list according to the filename

on.exit(setwd(oldDir)) # Reset the working directory
return(dl) # Return the data list
}
```

----
## Example with `source()`

```{r}
source("/Users/Daniel/BRT/Code/R/readFiles.R")
l <- readFiles("./data", pattern = ".csv")
names(l)
str(l)
```

----
## Lab (requires using last skills from last week)
* Load the **longley** dataset (from ./data)
* Write a function that fits 3 simple linear regression models, with `GNP`, 
  `Armed.Forces`, and `Population` as predictors of `Employed`. Return the output from each in a list, of class `mods`. Run the function and store the output in an object, `regs`.
* Write a default plot method for objects of class `mods`, which displays
  three scatter plots (using `par(mfrow = c(3,1))` and the regression line for each). Execute the function then run `plot(regs)`. If you do not get the three regression plots, you have an error.
* Write an infix function that tests whether the mean of one vector is within
  a standard deviation of the mean of the second vector. Test the function with `Unemployed` and `Armed.Forces`.

----
## Load **longley** dataset, write regression function and store results in 
  `regs`.

```{r}
long <- read.csv("./data/longley.csv")

mods <- function(d) {
	gnp <- lm(Employed ~ GNP, data = d)
	af <- lm(Employed ~ Armed.Forces, data = d)
	pop <- lm(Employed ~ Population, data = d)

	l <- list(GNP = gnp, ArmedForces = af, Population = pop)
return(structure(l, class = "mods")) 
}
regs <- mods(long)
str(regs[[1]])
```

----
## Produce default plot for class `mods`.

```{r}
plot.mods <- function(modList) {
	regPlot <- function(mod) {
		plot(mod$model[[2]], mod$model[[1]])
		abline(coef(mod)[1], coef(mod)[2], lwd = 2, col = "blue", lty = 2)
	}

	par(mfrow = c(3, 1))
	regPlot(modList[[1]])
	regPlot(modList[[2]])
	regPlot(modList[[3]])
}
```

---- &twocol

*** =left
# Issues with this plot
* x-axes differ, y-axes could (though they don't appear to here)
* Labels are not very informative
* Doesn't display any uncertainty of the regression line
* Others?

*** =right

```{r}
plot(regs)
```

----
## Infix function

```{r}
`%/>%` <- function(x, y) {
	mx <- mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
	my <- mean(y, na.rm = TRUE)
	sdy <- sd(y, na.rm = TRUE)

	mx >= my - sdy & mx <= my + sdy
}
```

----

```{r}
mean(longley$Unemployed)
mean(longley$Armed.Forces) - sd(longley$Armed.Forces)
mean(longley$Armed.Forces) + sd(longley$Armed.Forces)
```
<br>
---
```{r}
longley$Unemployed %/>% longley$Armed.Forces
```
