# Level 1

## Level 2

### Level 3 (etc.)


* Unordered list
  - inset
    + inset more
  - etc.

1. Ordered list
  a. blah blah
2. More stuff

```{r}
a <- 3
b <- 5

a + b * (exp(a)/b)
```

This is an example of inline code, where I want to refer to the sum of `a` and
  `b`, which is `r a + b`.


You can show code without evaluating it, using `eval = FALSE`. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
a + b * (exp(a)/b)
```

Alternatively, you can evaluate the code without displaying it

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data(mtcars)
with(mtcars, plot(mpg, hp, 
	xlab = "Miles Per Gallon", 
	ylab = "Horsepower",
	main = "Relation between Miles Per Gallon and Horsepower"))
```
