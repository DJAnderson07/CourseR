## What is R Markdown

*** =left
* Simple language for convering R code/output into other formats, most notably 
  HTML and PDF
* These slides were produced using a varient of Markdown
* Why is markdown useful?
  - Transparent and reproducible
  - Can (eventually) be more efficient
  - Simple for simple tasks (like homeworks)

*** =right
<div align = "center">

## YAML Front Matter

```
---
title: Example Markdown document
author: Daniel Anderson
date: "2015-09-17"
---
```

![frontMatter](assets/img/frontMatter.png)

* Three dashes before and after the YAML fields
* Case sensitive
* Many other fields are possible.
  + For example, you may want to include an `output:` argument (`pdf_document`,
    `html_document`, `word_document`). Must be specified as it is rendered, if
    not supplied.



---- &twocol
## Headings and Lists

*** =left

```
# Level 1
## Level 2 
### Level 3 (etc.)
```

```
* Unordered list
  - inset
    + inset more
  - etc.

1. Ordered list
  a. blah blah
2. More stuff
```

*** =right

![headersLists](assets/img/headersLists.png)

---- &twocol
## Code chunks

Start a code chunk with \`\`\`{r}, then produce some r code, then close the 
  chunk with three additional back ticks \`\`\`.

*** =left

![codechunk1](assets/img/codeChunk1.png)


```{r}
a <- 3
b <- 5

a + b * (exp(a)/b)
```

You can show code without evaluating it, using `eval = FALSE`. 

![codechunk2](assets/img/codeChunk2.png)

*** =right

Alternatively, you can evaluate the code without displaying it, using `echo = 
  FALSE`.

![codechunk3](assets/img/codeChunk3.png)

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 3.8}
data(mtcars)
with(mtcars, plot(mpg, hp, 
  xlab = "Miles Per Gallon", 
  ylab = "Horsepower",
  main = "Relation between Miles Per Gallon and Horsepower"))
```

-----
## Inline code

A single back tick followed by `r` prooduces inline code to be evaluated.

<div align = "center">
<img src = assets/img/inlineCode.png width = 1000 height = 80>
</div>
<br>

This is an example of inline code, where I want to refer to the sum of `a` and
  `b`, which is `r a + b`.


----- &twocol
## Rendering the document

*** =left

Through a text editor (e.g., SublimeText)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("rmarkdown")
library(rmarkdown)
setwd("dir/to/Rmd/doc")
render("ExampleRMarkdown.Rmd", 
  "html_document")
```

Note that the document type need not be specified if `output:` is supplied in 
  the YAML front matter. 

*** =right

Through RStudio

## Final remarks on R Markdown

* Make sure to look at the documentation
    + http://RMarkdown.rstudio.com
    + http://RMarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html
    + http://RMarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_rcodechunks.html

* Don't spend too much time fussing around with it
    + It's meant to be an easy way for me to see what you did and give you 
      feedback for homeworks. If you find yourself stuck, look at the 
      documentation, search google, and/or ask me for help

* The more you ask from it, the more complicated it will be. Basic usage is 
  pretty straightforward

# Directory management and reading/writing data

----
## Directory Management

What is a working directory?
  * Exactly what it sounds like--the directory from which R will work
  * Read and write files from and to this directory

Identify current working directory

```{r}
getwd()
```

------ 
## Looking into a working directory

What's in this directory? Two ways to find out:
* Navigate to the directory and take a look.
<div align = "left">
<img src = assets/img/currentDIR.png width = 500 height = 150>
</div>

* Have R look for you

```{r}
list.files()
```
The `list.files()` function shows what R "sees".

------
## Navigating your directory quickly
* Change directory from current location to a nested folder

```{r, eval = FALSE}
setwd("./nested/folders")
```
Here the `.` is essentially a fill-in for `getwd()`. 
* Navigate back one folder

```{r}
setwd("..")
```
* Navigate back two folders

```{r}
setwd("../..")
```

------
## Reading Data into R
To read data into R, you must tell R where the data are located by either 
  changing the working directory, or by providing the full path. For 
  example

```{r}
setwd("/Users/Daniel/Dropbox/Teaching/CourseR/data/")
d <- read.csv("cars.csv")
```  
is equivalent to
```{r}
d <- read.csv("/Users/Daniel/Dropbox/Teaching/CourseR/data/cars.csv")
```
Also note that the shortcuts for changing directories can be used here too, 
  which can often increase efficiency.

----
## My advice
* Set your working directory to where you want to save all your data files.
* Move the data you are working with to that file, or to a nearby folder 
  e.g.,

```{r, results = "hide"}
"(../raw)"
```

----
## What data can be read into R?
* R can read multiple data files
  - text files (csv, tab delimited, pipe delimited, etc)
  - web pages
  - SPSS, SAS, etc. (via the `foreign` or `memisc` packages)
  - Excel (I have not had great success here, and typically just convert it to 
    csv first)
  - relational and non-relational databases (I have no experience here, but I 
    know it is possible)
  - Directly entered data
* Simple text files are typically the most straightforward

----
## Diving deeper into reading data with R
```{r, eval = FALSE}
?read.table
```
<div align = "left">
<img src = assets/img/readTable.png width=900 height=500>
</div>

---- &twocol
## Important Arguments
*** =left
* `file`
  - name of file, including extension, in quotes
  - e.g. `"cars.txt"`
* `header` 
  - `read.table` defaults to `FALSE`
  - `read.csv` and others default to `TRUE`

*** =right
* `sep` 
  - `read.table` defaults to `""`
  - `read.csv` defaults to `","`
  - `read.delim` defaults to tab delimiter `"\t"`

* Others
  - `na.strings`
  - `skip`
  - `comment.char`
  - `stringsAsFactors`


---- &twocol
## Examples
*** =left
![excel](assets/img/carsExcel.png)
* Although csv files open in Excel, they are actually just text files

*** =right
![txt](assets/img/carsTxt.png)

----
## Examples

```{r}
getwd()
cars <- read.csv("./data/cars.csv")
```
* Use `head()` `tail()` and `str()` to check that the data were read in properly

```{r}
head(cars)
```

----
```{r}
tail(cars)
```

---- 

```{r}
str(cars)
```

----
## Learn more with `summary()`

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

---- &twocol
## A more complicated example
*** =left
* No column names
* pipe-delimited
* `NA` coded as 999
* `read.csv()` won't work here

*** =right
<div align = "left">
<img src = assets/img/treesData.png width = 200 height = 600>
</div>



----
* `read.table()`
* Explicit calls to 
  - `sep`, `na`, and `col.names`

```{r}
trees <- read.table("./data/trees.txt", sep = "|", na = "999", 
	col.names = c("Girth", "Height", "Volume"))
head(trees)
```
* Note that the column names are defined as a vector, via `c`.

---- 
## Last example: SPSS
![spss](assets/img/USViolentActs.png)

----
```{r}
library(foreign)
violence <- read.spss("./data/USViolentActs.sav", to.data.frame = TRUE)
head(violence)
```

---- &twocol
## More on reading SPSS files

*** =left

* It's a hassle
* Support is limited (and no longer being developed)
* Warnings are (for now) ignorable
* `foreign` package
* `to.data.frame = TRUE` is vital
* `Hmisc` package may be a better alternative (I haven't explored it much, and 
  generally try to avoid SPSS files)

*** =right

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?read.spss
```
![spssHelp](assets/img/spssHelp.png)

----
## Your turn
In the repository you cloned earlier in class, there is a folder called "data".
Read in the following files
* longley.csv
* attitude.txt

<span style="color:gray" > (You can work with a partner) </span>

----
The longley file is a csv, with headers, and can be read in pretty simply:

```{r}
longley <- read.csv("./data/longley.csv")
head(longley)
```

----
The attitude file is a bit more tricky. It's tab separated. We can use either
  `read.table()` or `read.delim()`.

```{r}
att <- read.table("./data/attitude.txt", sep = "\t")
att <- read.delim("./data/attitude.txt")
head(att)
```

----
## Subsetting data frames
* Data frames can be subset in numerous ways, including indexing equivalent to 
  matrices

```{r}
head(cars)
```
* Select the first 10 rows of the 3rd column

```{r}
cars[1:10,3]
```

----
Select the same elements, but keep the data frame intact

```{r}
cars[1:10,3, drop = FALSE]
```


----
## `str()` gives us a hint at an alternative subsetting method

```{r}
str(cars)
```


----
## Selecting columns by name
The `$` operator can also be used to select columns
* Select the `mpg` variable/column

```{r}
cars$mpg
```

* Select the `cyl` variable/column

```{r}
cars$cyl
```

---- &twocol
## A brief pause...Why so much focus on subsetting?
*** =left
* Used constantly in applied analysis work
	- analyze specific columns within a dataframe
	- explore differences in one variable by a factor
	- restrict the data (analytic sample as a subset of the full raw sample)

* Examples

```{r}
# Frequency of cylinders
table(cars$cyl)
```
*** =right

```{r fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4.5}
# plot the relation between horse
# power and miles per gallon
plot(cars$hp, cars$mpg)
```
Not the prettiest plot (and we'll make them prettier soon), but the subsetting
  allows us to select the columns we want for the plot.

---- &twocol
## A few more subsetting notes
*** =left
* Names can also be used within the `[]`, as long as they are supplied as a 
  string
* Multiple columns can be selected in this manner if a vector of names is 
  supplied
  - vectors are returned if you are using the `row , column` notation with a 
    single variable and you do not specifiy `drop = FALSE`
  - data frame maintained if only the names are supplied


* The following two lines of code are equivalent

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cars[c("mpg","cyl")]
cars[ ,c("mpg","cyl")]
```
*** =right
* As are these

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cars["mpg"]
cars[ ,"mpg", drop = FALSE]
```
* However, these are not

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cars["mpg"]
cars[ ,"mpg"]
```

* The first maintains the data frame, while the second returns a vector

---- &twocol
## Example

*** =left

```{r}
cars["mpg"]
```

*** =right

```{r}
cars[ ,"mpg"]
```

----
## Logical subsetting can also be used with data frames

```{r}
mpg25up <- cars$mpg > 25
cars[mpg25up, ]
```

```{r}
cars[cars$mpg > 25 & cars$gear == 5, ]
```

----
## How do these logical subsets work?

```{r}
cars$mpg > 25
cars$mpg > 25 & cars$gear == 5
```

----
## Final note on subsetting 
* The `subset()` function can be very useful for subsetting vectors, matrices, 
  or data frames

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?subset
```

<div align = "center">
<img src = assets/img/subsetHelp.png width = 1000 height = 650>
</div>


---- &twocol
## Examples of `subset`
* `x` = object to subset
* `subset` logical vector
* `select` optionally used to select columns

*** =left

```{r}
subset(cars, 
	subset = mpg > 25, 
	select = c("model", "mpg", "hp"))
```

*** =right

```{r}
subset(cars, hp > 220)
```

----
## Writing Data
* Write text files with essentially the same process, using `write.table()` or
  `write.csv()`

![writeTable](assets/img/writeTable.png)

----
## Example
* Write csv file

```{r, eval = FALSE}
write.csv(cars, file = "carsData.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

* Write dat file for mplus

```{r, eval = FALSE}
write.table(cars, file = "carsData.dat", 
  sep = "\t", 
  col.names = FALSE,
  row.names = FALSE,
  na = "999")
```

----
## Write an R file

```{r, eval = FALSE}
save(cars, file = "carsData.Rda")
```

Loading the data is then really easy

```{r, eval = FALSE}
load("carsData.Rda")
```

```{r}
head(cars)
```

----
## A note on writing R files
* When you load the `carsData.Rda` file, the object `cars` is loaded (i.e., it
  is not `carsData`). The reason is the file is `carsData`, but the object saved
  was `cars`. It's often helpful to keep them the same.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
carsData <- cars
save(carsData, file = "carsData.Rda")
```

* Other options (both readable by text editors)
  - `dump()`
  - `dput()` 

For the most part, I'd recommend either writing a text file or an r-specific 
  `.Rda` file.

----
## Homework

# Take a look: Anything appear confusing?
---
To receive full credit, please create and render an *R Markdown*  document in 
  html or pdf format that has the following elements.

- Title, author and date
    + Use a YAML header in your document to do this
- An R code chunk displaying how to load data into R and store it into an 
  object, along with text explaining  the code.
- A generic ordered or unordered list with at least one level of nesting (could 
  even be a shopping list)
- Some R output of some sort
- Calculate the mean of a variable, via `mean()` and display it in text. If 
  there are missing data in the vector that you are trying to calculate the mean
  from, you will also need to include the additional argument `na.rm = TRUE`. 
  Make some manipulation to the data (e.g., remove a few random cases) and 
  report the mean in text again, using code.

----
## Lab

Sort of an abbreviated version of the homework

* Create an R Markdown document (RStudio will create a template for you, if 
  you're going that route)
* Read in data from `CourseR/data/` (any one you choose)
* Display the first six rows of the data
* Subset the data so there are only 2 columns.
* Diplay the first 6 rows of the subset data
* Render the document
