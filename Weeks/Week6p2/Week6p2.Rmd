## Applying function by group

The `tapply()` function is useful for applying any generic function to each
  level of a grouping factor

![tapply](./assets/img/tapply.png)


----
## Load the beer data
```{r, loadBeer}
beer <- read.delim("./data/ratebeer_beerjobber.txt") # Load beer data
head(beer)
```

----
## Mean overall score by brewer

```{r, tapplyBrewerScore}
tapply(beer$score.overall, beer$brewer, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

----
## Number of beers rated by brewer

```{r, tapplyBrewerBeerN}
tapply(beer$name, beer$brewer, length)
```

----
## Average overall score by abv 

```{r, tapplyScoreByABV}
tapply(beer$score.overall, round(beer$abv), mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

----
## Make a summary by abv

```{r, abvSummary}
abv <- round(beer$abv)

smry <- data.frame(
  row.names = names(table(abv)),
  meanOverallScore = tapply(beer$score.overall, abv, mean, na.rm = TRUE),
  numberRatings = tapply(beer$ratings, abv, sum, na.rm = TRUE),
  numberBreweries = tapply(beer$brewer, abv, function(x) length(unique(x)))
  )
```

----
```{r, printsmry}
smry
```

----
## An alternative to tapply for summation

Just as `rowSums` and `colSums` are optimized versions of `apply` for summation, `rowsum` is an optimized version of `tapply` for summation.

Compute the total number of ratings by brewer

```{r, nRatingsByBrewer}
rowsum(beer$ratings, beer$brewer)
```

----
## Calculate average overall score for each brewer

```{r, BrewerScoreOverall}
tot <- rowsum(beer$score.overall, beer$brewer)
n <- tapply(beer$score.overall, beer$brewer, length)
av <- tot[ ,1]/n # Note tot is an integer matrix
as.matrix(av)
```

----
## The `by()` function

Apply a function to groups.

```{r, loadCensus}
library(openintro) # Lots of nice datasets (which I just discovered)
data(census)
head(census)
```

----
## Calculate means by state, race, and sex

```{r, meansCensus}
means <- by(census$totalPersonalIncome, 
              list(census$stateFIPScode, 
                   census$raceGeneral,
                   census$sex), mean, na.rm = TRUE)
means # Note there's a lot of missing data
```

----
## Structure of means

```{r, strMeans}
str(means)
```

----
## Compute marginal means by state

```{r, stateMeans}
apply(means, 1, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

----
## Compute marginal means by race/ethnicity

```{r, raceMeans}
apply(means, 2, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

----
## Compute marginal means by sex

```{r, sexMeans}
apply(means, 3, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

----
## Look within a particular state

```{r, OregonMeans}
means["Oregon", , ]
```

----
## Only individuals identifying as Black

```{r, BlackMeans}
means[ ,"Black", ]
```

----
## Only Males

```{r, maleMeans}
means[ , ,"Male"]
```

----
## The `aggregate()` Function

Aggregate is another way of summarizing data, but the output returned is different.

Note that a formula can be used.

```{r, aggregate1}
ag <- aggregate(totalPersonalIncome ~ stateFIPScode + raceGeneral + sex, 
        data = census, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
str(ag)
```

----
## View output

```{r, ag1}
ag[3:15, ]
```

----
## Compare to `tapply()`
The below output (and syntax, essentially) will produce exactly the same array
  produced earlier with `by()`, but that of course is different than `aggregate()`.

```{r, tapplyAggregate}
means2 <- with(census, tapply(totalPersonalIncome, 
                            list(stateFIPScode, raceGeneral, sex),
                          mean, na.rm = TRUE))
str(means2)
```

----
## Contrasting functions
Why `tapply()` or `by()` or `aggregate()`?
* The `aggregate()` function provides different output from the other two, 
  which may be preferable at times.
* `tapply()` and `by()` are essentially the same, but `by()` can occasionally
  produce summaries when `tapply()` fails

----
## Contrasting functions example
(Note. The example shown is from SabDeM on [SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3505701/r-grouping-functions-sapply-vs-lapply-vs-apply-vs-tapply-vs-by-vs-aggrega) (the response from joran there is also worth reading))

```{r, loadIris}
data(iris)
head(iris)
```

----
Note that `tapply()` fails in this context

```{r, tapplyFail}
tapply(iris, iris$Species, summary)
```
<br>

But `by()` can handle this situation

----
```{r, tapplyFail_byWins}
by(iris, iris$Species, summary)
```

----
## Finally: `sweep()`
* Used when you want to *sweep* a function across an array.
* Generally used when you want to apply an operation to an array, but the
  values differ for each column.

![sweep](./assets/img/sweep.png)

----
## Example

`sweep()` can be an efficient way to **center** variables, because you need to
   subtract each value within a column by the mean of that column (rather than subtracting a specific value from each column, in which case we'd just us `apply()`)

----
## Centering columns 4-7 in beer data
```{r, beerHead}
head(beer)
````

----
```{r, centerBeer1}
col_M <- colMeans(beer[ ,4:ncol(beer)], na.rm = TRUE)
col_M
centered <- sweep(beer[ ,4:ncol(beer)], 2, col_M, "-")
head(centered)
```

----
```{r, centerBeer2}
names(centered) <- paste0(names(centered), "_c")
names(centered)

# Check that centering worked properly
round(colMeans(centered, na.rm = TRUE), digits = 2)
```

----
## Put it all back together
```{r, centerBeer3}
beer <- cbind(beer, centered)
head(beer)
```

----
## Final Guided Practice
MLB salary data

```{r, loadMLB}
data(MLB)
head(MLB)
```

----
## Salary by position and team
First, transform salary to represent salary in millions

```{r, salaryByTeam1}
MLB$salary <- MLB$salary / 1000
```
Next, compute the average salary by team and position using the following two
  methods:

```{r, salaryByTeam}
array <- by(MLB$salary, list(MLB$team, MLB$position), mean)
dtaframe <- aggregate(salary ~ team + position, data = MLB, mean)
```
Use either of the summaries from above to answer the following two questions

1. Which team spends the most, on average, on pitchers?
2. Which team spends the least, on average, on shortstops?

Finally, compute the total salary by position an team, and answer Questions 1 and 2 again (only in sum, instead of on average).

----
## Solutions w/array

```{r, MLBarray}
array[ ,"Pitcher"]
array[ ,"Pitcher"][which.max(array[ ,"Pitcher"])]

array[ ,"Shortstop"][which.min(array[ ,"Shortstop"])]
```


----
## Solutions w/dtaframe

```{r, dtaframe}
pitchers <- subset(dtaframe, position == "Pitcher")
pitchers[which.max(pitchers$salary), ]

shortstops <- subset(dtaframe, position == "Shortstop")
shortstops[which.min(shortstops$salary), ]
```

----
## Recalculate with summing

```{r, summing}
arraySum <- by(MLB$salary, list(MLB$team, MLB$position), sum)
dtaframeSum <- aggregate(salary ~ team + position, data = MLB, sum)

arraySum[ ,"Pitcher"][which.max(arraySum[ ,"Pitcher"])]
arraySum[ ,"Shortstop"][which.min(arraySum[ ,"Shortstop"])]
```
